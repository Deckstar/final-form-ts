# master-form

## Introduction

> _Master Form_ is a state-management library for building top-down forms in JavaScript.

The goal of a "master form" is for all of your form logic — initial values, validation, submission logic etc. — to live in one place, preferably in one file.

## Acknowledgements

Master Form is a fork of Erik Rasmussen's Final Form, rewritten in TypeScript.
