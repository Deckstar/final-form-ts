# Examples

### [Vanilla JS Example](examples/vanilla)

You don't need any javascript framework to use Final Form's powerful subscription-based form state management. You can attach it directly to the DOM inputs.

### [Simple React Example](examples/react)

Demonstrates how Final Form can be used inside a React component to manage
form state. It also shows just how much
[React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form#-react-final-form)
does for you out of the box.
